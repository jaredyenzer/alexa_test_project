# alexa_test_project
First Project Interfacing with Amazon Alexa

This project creates a simple skill using CodeAcademy's simple free example

The first thing we will do is create the interaction model, also called the Voice User Interface (VUI) for our skill. We will do that using the Amazon Developer Portal.

Sign in to your Amazon Developer Account.
Click on Alexa in the top navigation bar.
Then, click on the Get Started button in the Alexa Skills Kit card.
